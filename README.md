During the first semester of my Minor all students indivudually had to create a weatherstation.
I used the esp8266 board for this project because it has a built in wifi-connector.

This weatherstation senses humidity, temperature, windspeed and fire.
It also was equiped with an LCD screen, a buzzer that made diferent noises depending on what the station was doing
and an RGB led meant to signify warnings or activity of the station.

All data was transmited to a firebase web app that I made as well showing all the diferent weather stations by students in the class.
